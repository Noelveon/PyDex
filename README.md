# PyDex

PyDex is a simple GUI to see the international pokedex, you can see the name, id, image, types and base stats of every pokemon.
It's my first project, so all feedback is useful.

***

If the window doesn't open, try to run updateDB.py and wait for the script to download an update Database. PyDex doesn't work if the database is missing or corrupted.

PyDex uses PokeAPI to get and update the database.

## Possible future updates:
- Play pokemon cry button
- Buttons sound
- Clock mode
- Music player mode
- Pomodoro mode
