# PyDex

PyDex is a simple GUI to see the international pokedex, you can see the name, id, image, types and base stats of every pokemon.
It's my first project, so all feedback is useful.

***

If the window doesn't open, try to run updateDB.py and wait for the script to download an updated Database. PyDex doesn't work if the database is missing or corrupted

***


PyDex uses PokeAPI to get and update the database
